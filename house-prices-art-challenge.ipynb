Instead of solely focusing on the physical features of a property, such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, buyers may also consider economic factors like the price, interest rates (not relevant in this context 😊), and the expected property appreciation.\n\nDuring the real estate boom in the USA, primarily in the early 2000s, there was a substantial increase in demand for properties, resulting in a considerable rise in home prices 📈🏠. During this period, many people viewed property purchases as a profitable investment, and some even transitioned into becoming real estate agents, capitalizing on the expanding market 📊💰.\n\n*Informative Addition*\n\nHowever, this real estate bubble was unsustainable, and in 2008, the subprime crisis occurred. This crisis was triggered by the collapse of the high-risk mortgage market (known as subprime mortgages), leading to mass borrower defaults and widespread property devaluation 📉🏚️. The real estate market collapsed, resulting in a significant economic recession in the USA and worldwide 🌍📉.\n\nThis financial crisis of 2008 had a lasting impact on the real estate sector and the overall economy, serving as a reminder of the risks associated with the real estate market and uncontrolled speculation. Since then, there have been significant changes in financial and mortgage regulations to prevent similar crises in the future 🏦🔒.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* The challenge seeks to find the best price prediction model for properties in the city of Ames, Iowa.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**I also took some inspiration and used some techniques of other people, but I did not hard-copied, he said**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Treatment","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Basic Packages \n\nimport sys\nimport scipy\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport numpy as np\n!pip install numpy\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n\nprint('Environment specification:\\n')\nprint('python', '%s.%s.%s' % sys.version_info[:3])\n\nfor mod in np, scipy, sns, pd:\n    print(mod.__name__, mod.__version__)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-28T12:14:32.335218Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-28T12:14:32.335624Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-28T12:14:49.087058Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-28T12:14:32.335592Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-28T12:14:49.085621Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/train.csv\")\ndf_test = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/test.csv\")\n\ndf = pd.concat([df_train, df_test], sort = True, ignore_index = True)\n\ndf.head(15)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-28T12:14:49.090068Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-28T12:14:49.090601Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-28T12:14:49.242403Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-28T12:14:49.090551Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-28T12:14:49.241057Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Let's check data type\n\ndef count_data_types(df):\n    data_types = df.dtypes\n    count = data_types.value_counts()\n    return count\n\nresult = count_data_types(df)\n\n#Show results dtypes\nprint(result)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-28T12:14:49.243937Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-28T12:14:49.244404Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-28T12:14:49.259351Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-28T12:14:49.244361Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-28T12:14:49.257940Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### SalesPrice Treatment","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Use the .describe() method to generate descriptive statistics\ndescription = df_train['SalePrice'].describe()\n\n# Print the descriptive statistics\nprint(description)\n\n# Create a figure with two subplots: boxplot and histogram\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 6))\n\n# Boxplot\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\nsns.boxplot(x=df_train['SalePrice'], ax=axes[0])\naxes[0].set_title('SalePrice Distribution (Boxplot)', fontsize=16)\naxes[0].set_xlabel('SalePrice', fontsize=14)\naxes[0].tick_params(axis='x', labelsize=12)\naxes[0].tick_params(axis='y', labelsize=12)\n\n# Histogram\nsns.histplot(df_train['SalePrice'], ax=axes[1], kde=True, color='skyblue')\naxes[1].set_title('SalePrice Distribution (Histogram)', fontsize=16)\naxes[1].set_xlabel('SalePrice', fontsize=14)\naxes[1].tick_params(axis='x', labelsize=12)\naxes[1].tick_params(axis='y', labelsize=12)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-28T12:14:49.262812Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-28T12:14:49.263251Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-28T12:14:50.263334Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-28T12:14:49.263214Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-28T12:14:50.261877Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**As it exhibits a non-normal probability distribution, it's crucial to conduct variable transformation tests to assess the attainment of a more 'normalized' distribution** 📊\n\nWe will test three different transformations (square root, logarithm, and Box-Cox) on the 'SalePrice' variable, and then it will display a boxplot alongside a histogram for each of them.

It is most often used when comparing statistical models that have been fitted to a data set, in order to identify the model that best fits the population from which the data were sampled. Exact \"F-tests\" mainly arise when the models have been fitted to the data using least squares. The name was coined by George W. Snedecor, in honour of Ronald Fisher. Fisher initially developed the statistic as the variance ratio in the 1920s. In summary, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a statistical technique used to compare the means of three or more groups or categories. It is often used to test whether there are significant differences between the population means of distinct groups. It provides a structured approach to hypothesis testing and allows for deeper insights into group differences. However, it's crucial to use ANOVA appropriately, considering its underlying assumptions and conducting post-hoc tests when necessary, to draw valid conclusions from your data.\n\n## Mathematical Formulation\n\n\nLet's assume you have $(k)$ groups with $(n_i)$ observations in each group, where $(i = 1, 2, ..., k)$.\n\nThe statistical hypotheses are formulated as:\n\n- **Null Hypothesis $(H_0)$:** All population means are equal.\n  \n  $H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\ldots = \\mu_k$\n\n- **Alternative Hypothesis $(H_1)$:** At least one population mean is different from the others.\n  \n  $H_1: \\text{At least one of the population means is different.}$\n\nThe F-test statistic is calculated as the ratio of between-group variability to within-group variability. The formula for the F-statistic is:\n\n$F = \\frac{\\text{Between-Group Variability}}{\\text{Within-Group Variability}}$\n\nWhere:\n\n- **Between-Group Variability** is the sum of squared differences between the means of each group and the overall mean, weighted by the number of observations in each group.\n  $\\text{Between-Group Variability} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i (\\bar{X}_i - \\bar{X})^2$\n  \n- **Within-Group Variability** is the sum of squared differences between each observation and the mean of the group to which it belongs.\n  \n  $\\text{Within-Group Variability} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (X_{ij} - \\bar{X}_i)^2$\n\nHere, $(\\bar{X}_i)$ represents the mean of group $(i)$, and $(\\bar{X})$ is the overall mean.\n\nFinally, the F-statistic follows an F-distribution with $(k-1)$ and $(N - k)$ degrees of freedom, where $(N)$ is the total number of observations.\n\n\n**Reference:**\n- [ANOVA - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance)\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define a function to perform ANOVA\ndef perform_anova(frame):\n    # Create an empty DataFrame to store results\n    anova_results = pd.DataFrame()\n    anova_results['Feature'] = qualitative  # Assuming qualitative is predefined\n\n    p_values = []\n\n    # Iterate through qualitative features\n    for feature in qualitative:\n        # Create a list to store samples for each category\n        samples = []\n\n        # Iterate through unique categories within the feature\n        for category in frame[feature].unique():\n            # Get SalePrice values for the current category\n            sale_prices = frame[frame[feature] == category]['SalePrice'].values\n            samples.append(sale_prices)\n\n        # Perform ANOVA test and get the p-value\n        p_value = stats.f_oneway(*samples)[1]\n        p_values.append(p_value)\n\n    # Add p-values to the DataFrame\n    anova_results['p-value'] = p_values\n\n    # Sort the results by p-value\n    anova_results = anova_results.sort_values(by='p-value')\n\n    return anova_results\n\n# Perform ANOVA on the 'train' DataFrame\nresult = perform_anova(df_train)\n\n# Calculate the disparity for visualization\nresult['Disparity'] = np.log(1.0 / result['p-value'].values)\n\n# Create a barplot to visualize the results\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.barplot(data=result, x='Feature', y='Disparity')\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.xlabel('Feature')\nplt.ylabel('Disparity (log(1/p-value))')\nplt.title('ANOVA Test Results')\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-28T12:15:13.594889Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-28T12:15:13.595459Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-28T12:15:14.904365Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-28T12:15:13.595409Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-28T12:15:14.902973Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Sort 'result' by the top 20 disparities\nresult_top_25 = result.sort_values(by='Disparity', ascending=False).head(25)\n\n# Get the names of variables from the top 20 results\ntop_25_features = result_top_25['Feature'].tolist()\n\n# Find the variables that match the names in 'top_20_features'\nmatching_variables = nan_columns[nan_columns.index.isin(top_25_features)]\n\ncols_to_fix = list(matching_variables.index)\n\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\n\n# Crie um gráfico de barras usando seaborn\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))  # Ajuste o tamanho do gráfico conforme necessário\nsns.barplot(x=matching_variables.index, y=matching_variables.values, palette=\"viridis\")\n\n# Rotacione os rótulos do eixo x para facilitar a leitura\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\n\n# Adicione rótulos e título\nplt.xlabel('Variáveis Correspondentes')\nplt.ylabel('Valores')\nplt.title('Variáveis Correspondentes entre \"nan_columns\" e Top 20 de \"result\"')\n\n# Ajuste automaticamente o layout para evitar cortar rótulos\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# Exiba o gráfico\nplt.show()\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-28T12:15:14.905933Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-28T12:15:14.906428Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-28T12:15:15.508864Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-28T12:15:14.906369Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-28T12:15:15.507435Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Categorical Variables to Address Missing Values for SalePrice Prediction:**\n\n   - FireplaceQu\n   - GarageCond\n   - GarageType\n   - GarageFinish\n   - GarageQual\n   - BsmtExposure\n   - BsmtQual\n   - BsmtCond\n   - BsmtFinType1\n   - MasVnrType\n   - Electrical","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Quantitative EDA","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Correlation (Spearman, Pearson, and Kendall)\n\nSpearman, Kendall, and Pearson are correlation coefficients used to measure the relationship between variables. Spearman is ideal for assessing monotonic relationships in ordinal data or when a non-linear relationship is suspected, as it focuses on rank orders. Kendall's Tau is also suitable for ordinal data and assesses the concordance of rankings, making it robust to outliers and non-linear relationships. Pearson is best suited for linear relationships between continuous variables, assuming a normal distribution. It's sensitive to outliers and may not capture non-linear associations effectively. The choice depends on the nature of the data and the type of relationship under investigation, with Spearman and Kendall being preferable when data is not normally distributed or non-linearity is expected.\n\n**Spearman Rank Correlation:**\n\n*Mathematical Definition:*\n\nThe Spearman rank correlation coefficient, denoted by $ρs$, is calculated as the correlation between the rankings (orders) of variables $X$ and $Y$. It is given by the formula:\n\n$\\rho_s = 1 - \\frac{6\\sum{d_i^2}}{n(n^2 - 1)}$\n\nWhere:\n- $d_i$ is the difference between the ranks of $X$ and $Y$ for the $i-th$ observation.\n- $n$ is the number of observations.\n\n**Pearson Correlation Coefficient:**\n\n*Mathematical Definition:* \n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient, denoted by $\\rho$ (rho), measures the linear correlation between two continuous variables $XX$ and $YY$.
